  <p class= "blue-section">
    Every episode has its ‘thing’ that it makes fun of and we will always laugh at whatever stupid thing Joey says, or snooze to Ross’s boring comments about dinosaurs, or laugh at Chandler’s closing joke, or giggle to a comment from Phoebe, or sympathize with Rachel as she finds her place in the real world or relate to Monica as she starts to clean the entire building from top to bottom. It doesn’t matter what kind of person YOU are, there will eventually be something about one of the friends that you can somehow relate to. Over the years you will most likely find something in each and every one of them, which makes the show that much better because the characters grow that more realistic.
